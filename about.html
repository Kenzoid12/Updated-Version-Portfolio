            <h1>Hello I'm Kenji Pontanar Patiño</h1>      
                <br>        
            <p>
                We get a lot of rain here, but that never really gets in the way of staying positive and motivated. 
                <br> Currently, I’m an In-plant Trainee in Computer Engineering Technology, and I’m really excited about the opportunity to put my skills to the test in a real-world setting.
                <br>
                <br>My main goal as an intern is to gain hands-on experience and dive deep into solving technical problems. 
                <br>I want to build a solid foundation by working on real projects and learning from professionals who have been in the field for years. 
                <br>I believe this experience will help me grow as an engineer and prepare me for the challenges of the tech world.
                <br>I'm passionate about understanding how technology works behind the scenes, whether it’s hardware or software. 
                <br>I’m always eager to tackle problems and find solutions that make a difference, and I’m hoping to expand my skills in areas like troubleshooting, system design, and development.
                <br>Along with gaining technical skills, I’m also looking to develop my ability to think critically and creatively when faced with challenges. 
                <br>Working in a dynamic environment, I know there will be opportunities to improve both my technical and interpersonal skills, and I’m excited about growing within the organization.
                <br>
                <br>Ultimately, my goal is to not just learn but to contribute, to be someone who can bring value to the team while continuing to grow as a professional. 
                <br>I’m looking forward to learning more, getting hands-on with the latest technologies, and making the most of this opportunity.
